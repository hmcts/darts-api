# Charts dev overrides

This directory contains overrides for the files in the `charts` directory. These overrides are used to replace the files in the development environment.

## Usage

Set a label on a PR, corresponding to the directory in here. For example, if the "enable_darts_portal" label is set then the files in the `enable_darts_portal` directory will be used to replace the files in the `charts` directory.
